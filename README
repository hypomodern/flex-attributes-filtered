FlexAttributesHelpers
====================

A collection of helpful model behavior for models that are using the flex_attributes plugin.
That would be the hypomodern flex attributes plugin, not the original one by Eric Anderson.
http://github.com/hypomodern/flex-attributes


Example
=======

Simply call `flex_filtered` in your model and give it any options you'd like, like so:

flex_filtered :attribute_name_delegate => :equipment_type,
              :attribute_name_delegate_method => :installation_field_names
              
That's the full list of the options hash. N.B. this plugin defines is_flex_attribute for you. It won't be much help if you override that method.
